# SapLabs-Frontend-Hackerearth-Challenge
This repository is a solution to the SAP LABS frontend challenge at Hackerearth. 
This solution gives top git projects language-wise. User has to enter language in search bar and then top git projects developed using that language is displayed. Search API of git is used to fetch data. It is developed using technologies like html5, bootstrap, angularjs and jquery. Everything is inside one html file. CSS is inside style element, angularjs and jquery code is inside script element. I strongly believe in reusability and separation of things but this was developed in an online editor in a screening test which lasted for 12 hours and final output which we get from them is combined into one html file. I have attached one screenshot folder also which shows how the UI appears.
